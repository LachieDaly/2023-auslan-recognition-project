# Auslan Isolated Sign Recognition

This repository contains the code of my thesis project which tested deep learning models which performed well with sign language and/or action datasets on Auslan Data.

The Auslan ELAR dataset was predominantly used for testing.

You can find a version of the following, either written from scratch or modified to work with AUSLAN datasets, and more recent versions of their python libraries.

1. Two Stream Network
2. Star RGB CNN transfer learning
3. Rastgoo's Deep Cascade Model (Flawed)
4. ChaLearn Transformer Model
5. SAM-SLR V2
6. Rastgoo Deep Cascade Model (Improved)
