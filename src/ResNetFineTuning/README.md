# Star RGB as input to pretrained ResNet

This paper mostly highlighted the preprocessing method StarRGB, but also trained a
ensemble of ResNet50 and ResNet101 to classify an action dataset

I found it performed quite well considering each video is condensed into a single frame.
However I don't believe we would have enough parameters to determine as the number of 
signs increases
